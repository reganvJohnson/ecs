# default values of 127.0.0.1 and 8448

# log_level defines the severity above which messages are written to

# the vast majority of the service is dedicated to
# co-ordinating a series of interactions with other services
# that expose RESTful APIs over HTTP(S). the objective of this
# configuration option is to put an upper bound on the number
# of concurrent http requests which can be simultaneously
# waiting for http responses from other services.
#
# the default value is 10

# this configuration option defines the endpoint ecs uses

#
# the default value is http://172.17.42.1:2375

#
# this configuration option defines max time (in milliseconds)

#
# this configuration option defines max time (in milliseconds)
