# the vast majority of the service is dedicated to
# co-ordinating a series of interactions with other services
# that expose RESTful APIs over HTTP(S). the objective of this
# configuration option is to put an upper bound on the number
# of concurrent http requests which can be simultaneously
# waiting for http responses from other services.
#
# the default value is 10

max_concurrent_executing_http_requests=250
